# Business card project

This is a project I made for a web development course I'm taking with Scrimba; it is pure HTML and CSS. I made this project to learn how to do more with CSS.

This is what I learned from this project:
 - using divs with classes to create graphics and organize a website
 - using pseudo-classes and pseudo-selectors, like `:hover` and `::after`
 - using flexbox to center elements
 - using viewport dimensions (`vh` and `vw`) to create scalable elements
 - using the `min()` function to designate a maximum size to scale to
 - using `box-shadow` property to create additional borders and drop-shadows
 - using custom fonts in a project via `woff2` files with the `@font-face` rule
 - creating simple animations with the `@keyframes` rule.
